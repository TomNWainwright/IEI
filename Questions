@@@ Preamble
Hello

The purpose of this interview is to consider how your conception of disability compares with the legal definition of disability covered under the equalities act of 2010 which is what Bristol university uses to determine whether somone has a disability for purposes of legal protection.

I will ask you a series of questions about your own opions of the concept of disability often alternating with an explanation of the concept of disability from the official guidance for the act.

I would like you to try to answer without trying to think what the legal conception might be just honestly what you think your everyday conception of disability is.Where your conception differs from the legal definition it does not necessarily mean your conception is incorrect, the legal definition is formal and for use in legal and administrative purposes and not necessarily for usage in everyday thinking about disability. Even for those purposes it may be imperfect and may well be lacking in areas which your conception may cover more fully. There are many examples where neither the legislation nor the guidance are particuarly helpful for example the guidance has many statements like the following, when attempting to clarify the meaning of the term likely "In this context, ‘likely’ should be interpreted as meaning ‘could well happen’", so the legislation should not be thought of as perfectly and infalibly crafted scripture.

I have stated this in the information sheet but I would like to stress again that at any time you may choose to end the interview or not answer, this is particuarly so for the next question which may be considered personal. If so I would stress that if you do not wish to disclose it is perfectly acceptable to answer this question with a no even if you feel the answer is yes, as you are not required to indicate that you do not wish to disclose, you may simply not disclose.

@@@ Q1
Do you consider yourself to have a disability? I must stress that if you do but do not wish to disclose it, it is perfectly fine to answer this question with a no.

@@@ Q2
How would you define disability?
@@>

@@@ legislative definition/guidance 1
The Act defines a disabled person as a person with a disability. A person has a disability for the purposes of the Act if he or she has a physical or mental impairment and the impairment has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on his or her ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities

@@@ Q3
What do you think of this definition? How much do you think it differs from your own?

@@@ Q4 substantial /longterm/everyday
What do you make of the terms:
substantial
long term
everyday activities

@@@ Guidance 2: Substantial
The meaning is intended to reflects the general understanding of disability as a limitation going beyond the normal differences in ability which may exist among people. A substantial effect is one that is more than a minor or trivial effect.

Time taken
  The time taken  by a person with an impairment to carry out a normal day-to-day activity should be considered when assessing whether the effect of that impairment is substantial. It should be compared with the time it might take a person who did not have the impairment to complete an activity.

Manner of approach to activity
  The comparison should be with the way that the person might be expected to carryout the activity compared with someone who does not have the impairment.For example a person who has obsessive OCD constantly checks when leaving home which would count as a substantial effect.

The effects of all impairments should be considered cumulatively

@@@ Q5
How does that compare with your concept of substantial effects?

@@@ Guidance 3: Long Term

The Act states that, for the purpose of deciding whether a person is disabled, a long-term effect of an impairment is one:
which has lasted at least 12 months;
or where the total period for which it lasts, from the time of the first onset, is likely to be at least 12 months;
or which is likely to last for the rest of the life of the person affected.

The Act states that, if an impairment has had a substantial adverse effect on a person’s ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities but that effect ceases, the substantial effect is treated as continuing if it is likely to recur.
It is not necessary for the effect to be the same throughout the period which is being considered in relation to determining whether the‘long-term’ element of the definition is met. A person may still satisfy the long-term element of the definition even if the effect is not the same throughout the period. It may change: for example activities which are initially very difficult may become possible to a much greater extent.

Likelihood of recurrence should be considered taking all the circumstances of the case into account. This should include what the person could reasonably be expected to do to prevent the recurrence.

@@@  Guidance 4 everyday activities

In general, day-to-day activities are things people do on a regular or daily basis, and examples include shopping, reading and writing,having a conversation or using the telephone, watching television,getting washed and dressed, preparing and eating food, carrying out household tasks, walking and travelling by various forms of transport,and taking part in social activities.

Normal day-to-day activities can include general work-related activities, and study and education related activities, such as interacting with colleagues, following instructions, using a computer, driving, carrying out interviews,preparing written documents, and keeping to a timetable or a shift pattern.

Account should also be taken of where a person avoids doing things which, for example, cause pain, fatigue or substantial social embarrassment, or avoids doing things because of a loss of energy and motivation.

In some cases, people have coping or avoidance strategies which cease to work in certain circumstances (for example, where someone who has dyslexia is placed under stress). If it is possible that a person’sability to manage the effects of an impairment will break down so that effects will sometimes still occur, this possibility must be taken into account when assessing the effects of the impairment.

The term ‘normal day-to-day activities’ is not intended to include activities which are normal only for a particular person, or a small group of people. In deciding whether an activity is a normal day-today activity, account should be taken of how far it is carried out by people on a daily or frequent basis. A normal day-to-day activity is not necessarily one that is carried out by a majority of people. For example, it is possible that some activities might be carried out only, or more predominantly, by people of a particular gender, such as breast-feeding or applying make-up, and cannot therefore be said to be normal for most people. They would nevertheless be considered to be normal day-to-day activities.

Also, whether an activity is a normal day-to-day activity should not be determined by whether it is more normal for it to be carried out at a particular time of day. For example, getting out of bed and getting dressed are activities that are normally associated with the morning.So for example shift work is covered.

Where activities are themselves highly specialised or involve highly specialised levels of attainment, they would not be regarded as normal day-to-day activities for most people. In some instances work related activities are so highly specialised that they would not be regarded as normal day-to-day activities.
The same is true of other specialised activities such as playing a musical instrument to a high standard of achievement;  they would not be regarded as normal day-to-day activities for most people.

Environmental conditions may have an impact on how an impairment affects a person’s ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities.Consideration should be given to the level and nature of any environmental effect.

It would be reasonable to expect a person with a phobia to avoid extreme activities or situations etc him or her to give up,or modify, normal activities that might exacerbate the symptoms.
