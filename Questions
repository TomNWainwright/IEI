Hello

How would you define disability

The Act defines a disabled person as a person with a disability. A person has a disability for the purposes of the Act if he or she has a physical or mental impairment and the impairment has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on his or her ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities (S6(1)).



What do you make of the terms substantial

long terms

everyday activities4



•	the person must have an impairment that is either physical ormental (see paragraphs A3 to A8);
•	the impairment must have adverse effects which are substantial(see Section B);
•	the substantial adverse effects must be long-term (see Section C);and
•	the long-term substantial adverse effects must be effects onnormal day-to-day activities (see Section D).


The definition requires that the effects which a person may experience must arise from a physical or mental impairment. The term mental or physical impairment should be given its ordinary meaning. It is not necessary for the cause of the impairment to be established, nor does the impairment have to be the result of an illness. In many cases,there will be no dispute whether a person has an impairment. Any disagreement is more likely to be about whether the effects of the impairment are sufficient to fall within the definition and in particular whether they are long-term. Even so, it may sometimes be necessary to decide whether a person has an impairment so as to be able to deal with the issues about its effects.
