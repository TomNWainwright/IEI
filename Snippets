for purposes of validity it would have been better to give the participants an option to say they do not wish to disclose as this would allow me to more easily distinguish between those not disclosing and those definitely without a disability. However this would be ethically dubious as participants would likely (and quite reasonably) feel that to not disclose would essentially indicate that they did have a disability but were not willing to say, as it is unlikely that somone who did not consider themselves to have a disability would choose not to disclose that fact, as such disclosure carries no real stigma or potential for discrimination.

As these ethical concerns overide the concerns about validity I chose to ask participants whether they did or did not consider that they had a disability but to inform them that if they did not wish to disclose a disability it was perfectly fine to simply answer that they did not have one.
